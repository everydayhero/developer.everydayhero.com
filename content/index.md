## The everydayhero API

This describes the API resources that make up the everydayhero Fundraiser API
v2, and everydayhero Passport API v1 (OAuth2). If you have any problems or
requests please email [api@everydayhero.com](mailto:api@everydayhero.com).

Most functionality is available via OAuth endpoints, which can be accessed with
[OAuth Integration](/oauth-integration/#how-to-authenticate-with-edh-passport).
However, some resources will require additional credentials
(see [Authentication](/authentication/)) you will need to contact the above
email for credentials.
