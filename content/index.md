<p class="notice">Support for the everydayhero® platform will end on 30 November 2020. After that date, you will no longer be able to launch campaigns and fundraising pages, pull data or accept donations using everydayhero. The good news is you can continue to raise money online and build fundraising integrations using our JustGiving® platform and its API stack. <a href='https://developer.justgiving.com/'>Learn more about JustGiving’s developer tools</a></p>          


## The everydayhero API

This describes the API resources that make up the everydayhero Fundraiser API
v2, and everydayhero OAuth API v1 (OAuth2). If you have any problems or
requests please email [api@everydayhero.com](mailto:api@everydayhero.com).

Most functionality is available via OAuth endpoints, which can be accessed with
[OAuth Integration](/oauth-integration/#how-to-authenticate-with-edh).
However, some resources will require additional credentials
(see [Authentication](/authentication/)) you will need to contact the above
email for credentials.
